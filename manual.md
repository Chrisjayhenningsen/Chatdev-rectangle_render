# Rectangle Renderer User Manual

## Introduction

The Rectangle Renderer is a Python application that prompts the user for two numerical variables and renders a rectangle with orthogonal lines of the same relative size as the two variables given. This user manual provides instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies and how to use the software.

## Installation

To use the Rectangle Renderer, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- tkinter library

You can install the required dependencies by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the Rectangle Renderer files.
3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install the tkinter library.

## Usage

To use the Rectangle Renderer, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the Rectangle Renderer files.
3. Run the following command to start the application:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

4. The application window will open, prompting you to enter the width and height of the rectangle.
5. Enter the desired values for width and height in the respective entry fields.
6. Click the "Render" button to render the rectangle.
7. A new window will open, displaying the rendered rectangle with orthogonal lines.

Note: Make sure to enter numeric values for the width and height. If you enter invalid input, an error message will be displayed.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the Rectangle Renderer:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the Rectangle Renderer files.
3. Run the following command to start the application:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

4. The application window will open.
5. Enter the width as 200 and the height as 100.
6. Click the "Render" button.
7. A new window will open, displaying a rectangle with orthogonal lines of width 200 and height 100.

## Conclusion

The Rectangle Renderer is a simple yet powerful tool for rendering rectangles with orthogonal lines. By following the installation and usage instructions provided in this user manual, you can easily use the software to create and visualize rectangles based on user-defined dimensions.
